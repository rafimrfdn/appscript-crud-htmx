# CRUD operation to works with App Script runs on localhost via Express JS

I create the frontend from this gist:

```
https://gist.github.com/richardblondet/ce87a397ef669d4d25dd21ea02b9dda1
```

## This project is using this tech stack to run :
- Express JS
- Axios
- body-parser
- nodemon
- HTMX

## what works?
- create
- read
- delete

## todo
- update
